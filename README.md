 📊 PhonePe Transaction Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

🔎 Project Overview

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** built using a PhonePe-style transaction dataset to analyze:

* Total number of transactions
* Total transaction amount
* Successful vs Failed transactions
* Failure reasons (Wrong PIN, Server Error, Insufficient Amount, etc.)
* Monthly transaction trends
* Transfer type distribution

The goal of this project is to create a **portfolio-ready Data Analyst dashboard** that demonstrates **data modeling, DAX, visualization design, and business insights**.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI Desktop**
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
* **Excel Dataset**
* **Data Visualization & Dashboard Design**
* **Business KPI Analysis**

 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple tables such as:

* **All_Transactions**

  * Transaction_ID
  * User_ID
  * Date
  * Amount
  * Payment_Status
  * Reason
  * Transfer_Type

* Additional domain tables:

  * Insurance
  * Loans
  * Money Transfer
  * Recharge & Bills

These tables are used to simulate **real-world digital payment analytics**.

📈 Key KPIs Created

Core Measures

* **Total Transactions**
* **Total Amount**
* **Successful Transactions**
* **Failed Transactions**

Advanced Metrics

* **Success Rate %**
* **Average Transaction Amount**
* **Failure Reason Distribution**
* **Monthly Amount Trend**

All KPIs are built using **DAX measures** instead of page filters to ensure **dynamic filtering with slicers**.

🎨 Dashboard Features

* PhonePe-inspired **UI theme & color palette**
* **Date range slicer** for dynamic filtering
* **KPI cards** for quick insights
* **Donut & pie charts** for status and failure analysis
* **Bar chart** for transfer type comparison
* **Area/line chart** for monthly trend visualization
* Multi-page navigation:

  * Home
  * Insurance
  * Loans
  * Money Transfer
  * Recharge & Bills

🧠 Business Insights

The dashboard helps answer:

* What is the **total transaction volume and value**?
* What percentage of transactions are **successful vs failed**?
* Which **failure reason** occurs most frequently?
* How do **transactions vary month-by-month**?
* Which **transfer type** contributes the highest amount?

These insights are useful for **digital payment monitoring, fraud detection, and performance tracking**.
